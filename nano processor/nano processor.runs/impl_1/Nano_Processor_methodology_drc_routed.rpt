2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
LUTAR-1#1 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell Program_Counter/jump_flag_reg_i_2, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous reset pin(s) instruction_Decoder_0/address_jump_reg[0]/CLR, instruction_Decoder_0/address_jump_reg[1]/CLR, instruction_Decoder_0/address_jump_reg[2]/CLR, instruction_Decoder_0/jump_flag_reg/CLR. The LUT may glitch and trigger an unexpected reset, even if it is a properly timed path.
Related violations: <none>

LUTAR-1#2 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell Program_Counter/load_sel_reg_i_2, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous reset pin(s) instruction_Decoder_0/load_sel_reg/CLR. The LUT may glitch and trigger an unexpected reset, even if it is a properly timed path.
Related violations: <none>
